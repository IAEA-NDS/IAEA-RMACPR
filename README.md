IAEA Repository for R-matrix Analysis of charged-particle and neutron-induced reactions 

The International Nuclear Data Evaluation Network on the evaluation of Light Elements (INDEN-LE) focuses on evaluating 
charged-particle- and neutron-induced reactions in the resolved resonance region for light composite systems that are 
important in energy applications, nonproliferation, waste management, ion beam analysis, and nuclear astrophysics. 

The following R-matrix codes have been compared systematically and used in R-matrix analyses and evaluations in this project:
AMUR (JAEA), AZURE2 (Note Dame), CONRAD (CEA), EDA (LANL), GECCCOS (TUW), RAC (Tsinghua U), SAMMY (ORNL), SFRESCO (LLNL)

Compound systems of interest to the network: i) 7Be (p+6Li; 3He+4He), ii) 17O, iii) 15N, iv) 10Be.

The experimental databases, resonance parameter files, and R-matrix results obtained form the codes are included in this repository.
